Eric Griffin's Personal Site:

This is my first major website project. It is a mock portfolio page.

The webpage consists of a Homepage with a persistent navigation bar that links to an About page and a Portfolio page and a Contact page. I also added a Form Submitted page that the user is redirected to when the click the submit button on the form.

Each page has a persistent footer than contains a button that causes the "Hello World" alert pop-up when clicked except for the Form Submitted page.

The Home page features a central box with a brief description, a quote, and a picture.

The About page contains blurbs about other activities I like and some images to accompany them.

The Portfolio page has a few images of freelance graphic design projects I did and brief description of each.

The Contact page contains text forms for the First and Last Name and Email. It also has a textbox for comments. It has a functioning submit button that takes the user to the Form Submitted Page.

The Form Submitted Page has a message for the user and a link to go back to the Home Page.

I built each page in HTML, each having it's own .html file. I used a single .css file to style each page, and I linked it to each html document.

I have one JavaScript file that contains script for the "Hello World" pop-up button function.
